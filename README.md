## Purpose

This app has 2 dual purposes: To allow users to get up-to-the-minute updates
on the schedules of BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) trains, and to allow users
to simultaneously access entertainment options within the app so they can
keep an eye on train arrivals and departures. The app allows access to data from
all BART stations in all directions. Many BART stations do not have public
departure and arrival estimate displays, and this app allows users the confidence
in having accurate data.
Since my first instinct when seeing a wait time of over a few minutes is to
go on YouTube, I made an app where it is possible to both watch YouTube videos and
have access to train times.
As an additional entertainment feature in case the user is waiting with someone else, there is also the ability to play tic-tac-toe.

## Technologies Used

With this being a static frontend app, the extent of my technologies used is
HTML, CSS for design, Javascript for functionality, and jQuery for DOM manipulation
