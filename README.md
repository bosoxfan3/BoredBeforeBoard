Purpose
-------
This app has 2 dual purposes: To allow users to get up-to-the-minute updates
on the schedules of BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) trains, and to allow users
to simultaneously access entertainment options within the app so they can
keep an eye on train arrivals and departures. The app allows access to data from 
all BART stations in all directions. Many BART stations do not have public
departure and arrival estimate displays, and this app allows users the confidence
in having accurate data.
Since my first instinct when seeing a wait time of over a few minutes is to
go on YouTube, I made an app where it is possible to both watch YouTube videos and 
have access to train times. I added Chuck Norris and Ron Swanson joke generators
both for nostalgia's sake and for the times when you have either a short wait or
a lack of good enough cellular signal for YouTube.
As an additional entertainment feature in case the user is waiting with someone else, there is also the ability to play tic-tac-toe.
