## üéØ Purpose

This app serves two purposes:

-   Offer built-in **entertainment options** (YouTube search and Tic-Tac-Toe) so users can pass time without switching apps.

It‚Äôs designed for fast access, clean display, and mobile-friendliness. Whether you're waiting solo or with a friend, there's something to do while keeping tabs on your next train.

## üöÄ Setup & Usage

### 1. Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/bosoxfan3/BoredBeforeBoard.git
cd BoredBeforeBoard
```

### 2. About the API Keys

This project requires API keys for YouTube and BART to function.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è API keys used in this project are intentionally exposed for demonstration purposes. They are restricted to specific domains and only allow read-only access. In a production environment, sensitive keys should be kept server-side or behind a build system.

### Option 1: Use the app as-is (read-only keys included)

The `config.js` file is included for demo purposes with domain-restricted, read-only API keys. You can use the app without modification.

### Option 2: Use your own API keys (recommended for contributors)

If you'd like to fork or modify the project, create a file named `config.js` in the root of the project and define your own keys:

```
const YOUTUBE_API_KEY = 'YOUR_YOUTUBE_API_KEY_HERE';
const BART_API_KEY = 'YOUR_BART_API_KEY_HERE';
```

You can get a YouTube API key in the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
and can explore BART API key choices [here](https://www.bart.gov/schedules/developers/api)

### üîí Disclaimer

Your API keys are exposed in the frontend, so make sure to restrict the YouTube key in the Google Cloud Console to specific domains (e.g., yourdomain.com/\*) if deploying.

### 3. Open the app in a browser

Just open index.html in your browser ‚Äî no build or server required.
